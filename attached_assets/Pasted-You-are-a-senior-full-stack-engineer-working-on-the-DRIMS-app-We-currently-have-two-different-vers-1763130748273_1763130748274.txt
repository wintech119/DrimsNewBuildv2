You are a senior full-stack engineer working on the DRIMS app.

We currently have two different versions of the workflow sidebar:

Correct Sidebar – labeled “Workflow Progress” with:

Blue header bar with icon + “Workflow Progress”

Vertical green timeline line

Green filled circles with ✓ for completed steps

Blue circle for the current step

Grey/outlined circle for upcoming steps

Step title in bold, small subtitle below (e.g. “Approved by ODPEM Director”)

Clean spacing and alignment

Incorrect Sidebar – labeled “Workflow” with:

Different header label (“Workflow”)

Different icon/spacing

Different circle styles and alignment

Slightly different typography

Goal

All workflow sidebars across the app must look and behave like the “Correct Sidebar” version.
The “Incorrect Sidebar” look should not appear anywhere.

Requirements

Create a single reusable Workflow Sidebar component

Implement a shared component/partial (template, React/Vue component, etc., depending on the stack) for the workflow sidebar.

This component must:

Use the “Workflow Progress” header text.

Render the timeline with:

Vertical green connecting line.

Green filled circles with checkmark for completed steps.

Blue filled circle for the current step.

Green outlined circle (or subtle style) for future steps.

Accept a list of steps like:

Submitted – PORTMORE COMMUNITY CENTER

Eligibility Review – Approved by ODPEM Director

Package Prepared – By Logistics Officer

LM Approval – Awaiting your review

Dispatch – To Inventory Clerk

Support dynamic states: completed, current, upcoming.

Unify styling

Move all workflow sidebar CSS into a single place (e.g. workflow-sidebar.css or existing main stylesheet).

Ensure:

Same font sizes, weights, and line-height as the Correct Sidebar.

Consistent padding, card radius, and shadows.

Same icon in the header as the Correct Sidebar.

Remove or override any old/legacy CSS that produces the Incorrect Sidebar appearance.

Replace all existing workflow sidebars

Find all pages where a workflow sidebar appears (e.g. relief request, eligibility review, packaging/prepare, approvals, dispatch, etc.).

Replace their existing sidebar markup with the new shared Workflow Sidebar component.

Make sure each page passes the correct steps and current step index to the component.

Behavior

The component should:

Highlight the current step in blue.

Mark earlier steps as completed with a green circle + checkmark.

Show later steps as upcoming.

Do not change backend logic; only use data that is already available in the view/context.

Accessibility & UX

Ensure the sidebar remains keyboard accessible.

Use sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA) for text against the white background and for the blue/green states.

Keep layout responsive so it still looks clean on narrower screens.

Refactoring notes

Do not change any database tables or backend workflow states.

Only refactor templates/components and CSS/JS as needed to standardize the UI.

Add brief comments in the shared component explaining how to use it (props/parameters for steps and current step).

Implement this so that every workflow sidebar in the app uses the unified “Workflow Progress” design and no page shows the older “Workflow” sidebar style.

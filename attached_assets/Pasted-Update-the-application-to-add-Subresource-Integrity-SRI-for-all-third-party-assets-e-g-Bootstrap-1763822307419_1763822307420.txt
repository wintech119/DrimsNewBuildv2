Update the application to add Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all third-party assets (e.g. Bootstrap, icons, other libraries) loaded from a CDN, without breaking any existing code, logic, workflow, behaviour, UI, or database schema.

Scope

Identify all external CDN assets

Search all templates/layouts (e.g. base HTML, Jinja, etc.) for:

<script src="https://...">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://...">

Especially:

Bootstrap CSS/JS

Icon libraries (e.g. Bootstrap Icons, Font Awesome, etc.)

Any other third-party JS/CSS loaded from a CDN.

Add SRI attributes

For each external CDN <script> or <link> tag:

Add a correct integrity attribute with the exact hash for the exact version being used.

Add crossorigin="anonymous".

Example structure (adjust to actual versions and correct hashes):

<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  integrity="sha384-<correct-hash-here>"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
>

<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"
  integrity="sha384-<correct-hash-here>"
  crossorigin="anonymous"
></script>


Do NOT use placeholder hashes; generate or copy the official hashes for the exact CDN URLs currently used.

No breaking changes

Do not:

Change any JavaScript logic or functions.

Change any CSS classes or layout structure.

Change any routes, views, controllers, or backend logic.

Modify any database schema, tables, columns, triggers, or data.

The only changes should be:

Adding integrity="..." and crossorigin="anonymous" to external CDN resource tags.

Version safety

Do not upgrade or downgrade any library versions just to match sample SRI hashes.

Keep the exact existing CDN URLs and versions, and compute/find the matching SRI hash for each one.

Validation / Outcome

After the change:

Security scans must show:

No external Bootstrap / icon / third-party scripts/styles are loaded without SRI.

The DMIS/DRIMS application must:

Look the same.

Function the same (all pages, buttons, forms, modals, icons, dashboards).

Have no new console errors related to loading resources.

Use this to refactor the templates so all CDN assets are protected with SRI while keeping the app’s behaviour 100% unchanged.

Add a new tab for LM to see approved requests with no allocated items. Do NOT change the database schema; reuse existing DRIMS UI and navigation.

1. New Tab

On the Relief Request / Fulfillment screen for the Logistics Manager (LM), add a new tab, for example named:
“Approved – No Items Allocated” or “Approved (No Allocation)”.

Use the same visual style as the existing tabs (Being Prepared, Awaiting Approval, Approved for Dispatch, etc.).

2. Filtering Logic for the New Tab

This tab must list only relief requests / packages that meet both of the following conditions:

The package has been approved by the LM (i.e. it is in an approved / completed LM status – use the existing LM-approved status code).

No items were allocated in the package, meaning for that relief request/package:

All requested items have allocated_qty = 0 (or issue_qty = 0, depending on your existing allocation/issue field), and

There are no batch allocations recorded against those items.

Requests that have any non-zero allocated/issue quantity must not appear in this tab.

3. Behaviour with Other Tabs

These “approved with no allocation” requests must not appear in normal “Approved for Dispatch” / “Dispatched” tabs that expect items to be issued.

Make sure status filters for:

Being Prepared

Awaiting Approval

Approved for Dispatch

Approved (No Allocation)
are mutually consistent so that each request appears only where it logically belongs.

4. Display Columns

In the new tab, show at least:

Request ID / Tracking No (e.g. RR-000036)

Agency name

Requested date / Required date

LM approver name

Approval date/time

High-level reason/status (e.g. “No stock available / Unavailable”).

Clicking a row should open the standard read-only view of the request and its items, showing clearly that all items are unallocated (0 issued).

5. General

Do not modify any tables or schema; derive everything from existing request, item, allocation/issue, and status fields.

Keep all existing styling, routing, and navigation; this is an additional tab and filter logic only.

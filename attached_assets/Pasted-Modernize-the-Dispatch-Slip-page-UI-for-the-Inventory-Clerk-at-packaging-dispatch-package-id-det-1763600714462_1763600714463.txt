Modernize the Dispatch Slip page UI for the Inventory Clerk at

/packaging/dispatch/<package_id>/details (example: /packaging/dispatch/6/details), while keeping existing functionality and navigation intact.

1. Keep core actions and behaviour

Do NOT remove or rename the following buttons:

“Print Dispatch Slip” – must continue to open/trigger the printable slip view.

“Mark as Handover” – must continue to update the dispatch status and notify the LM and LO as it currently does.

All existing notification logic, routing, and backend behaviour must remain unchanged. This is a UI/UX refresh only.

2. Modernize layout & visual design

Refresh the page using a clean, modern layout while keeping DRIMS colours, fonts, and branding.

Organize the content into clearly separated sections, for example:

Agency Information (agency name, contact, request ID)

Dispatch Details (date, warehouse, clerk, LM info)

Itemized List (item, requested qty, issued qty, UOM, batch/lot where applicable)

Signature Section for the requesting agency.

Improve spacing, alignment, and typography for readability:

Consistent padding and margins.

Neat column alignment for item rows and quantities.

Use card or panel-style grouping to visually separate sections without clutter.

3. Print-friendly design

Ensure “Print Dispatch Slip” produces a clean, print-optimized layout:

No sidebars or navigation chrome.

Minimal, light borders and clear section headers.

Suitable for A4/Letter printing.

The printed slip must include:

Agency info, request/package ID.

All items for this warehouse, with requested vs issued quantities.

Warehouse and date/time details.

A professional signature block:

Received By (Agency): _______

Signature: _______

Date: _______

Inventory Clerk Name: _______

4. General constraints

Do not change any database schema or business logic.

Preserve existing routing, permissions, and notification behaviour.

Only update the front-end layout and styling so the page looks modern, is easy to read, and works very well as a printable dispatch slip, while still exposing Print Dispatch Slip and Mark as Handover as primary actions.

Implement warehouse-specific dispatch receiving for Inventory Clerks, plus feedback queues for LO and LM. Do NOT change any database schema. Reuse existing DRIMS UI style and navigation.

1. Inventory Clerk – “Awaiting Dispatch” by Warehouse

On the Inventory Clerk dashboard, add or update a tab (e.g. “Awaiting Dispatch”) that lists only approved relief packages/items for that clerk’s warehouse/inventory.

Filtering rules:

Only show items where the package has been approved by the LM and is in a “Ready for Dispatch” state.

Only include items whose allocations reference the clerk’s warehouse/inventory_id.

Inventory Clerks must not see items or allocations for other warehouses/inventories.

For each entry, show:

Relief request / package ID

Agency name

Warehouse name (their own)

Item, requested qty, allocated/issue qty for that warehouse

Date/time approved by LM

2. Inventory Clerk – Dispatch Details & Printable Slip

When the clerk opens a dispatch entry:

Show a Dispatch Details page containing:

Request/package information

All items allocated from that warehouse only (no other warehouses).

Requested vs Issued quantities, batch/lot info if available.

Provide a Print Dispatch Slip view/button with a print-friendly layout.

The printed slip must include a signature section for the requesting agency, e.g.:

Agency name

“Received by: ____________________”

“Signature: ____________________”

“Date: ____________________”

The layout must follow existing DRIMS styling (fonts, colours, buttons) but be optimized for printing (no sidebars, minimal chrome).

3. Marking Dispatch as Received

On the Inventory Clerk’s Dispatch Details page, add a control (e.g. “Mark as Dispatched / Handed Over”).

When the clerk confirms:

Update the package/item status to indicate dispatch completed / items handed over for that warehouse.

Trigger notifications and queue updates for LO and LM (see below).

Ensure this action is auditable (who, when).

4. LO & LM – Dispatch Receipt Queue

For Logistics Officer (LO) and Logistics Manager (LM) dashboards, add a tab such as “Dispatch Received” or “Completed Dispatches”.

This tab must list relief packages/items where:

The LM previously approved and dispatched.

The Inventory Clerk has marked the dispatch as handed over/received.

For each record, show:

Request/package ID

Agency name

Warehouse(s) that completed dispatch

Date/time the clerk marked it as handed over

Status (e.g. “Dispatched / Awaiting Signed Slip Return” or “Completed”).

Clicking an entry should open a read-only view of the dispatch details (similar to the clerk’s printable view) so LO/LM can review what was issued.

5. Notifications

When an Inventory Clerk marks a dispatch as handed over:

Send an in-app notification to LO and LM (according to existing notification patterns) indicating:

The package has been dispatched.

Warehouse name and date/time.

Clicking the notification must take LO/LM directly to the dispatch details / completed dispatch view.

6. General Constraints

Do not modify any database tables or schema; use existing package, allocation, inventory, and notification structures.

Maintain all existing RBAC rules and DRIMS visual style; these changes are additional filtering, pages, and queues on top of current logic.

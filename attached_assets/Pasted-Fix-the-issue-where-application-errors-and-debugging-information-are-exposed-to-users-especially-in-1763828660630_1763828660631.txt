Fix the issue where application errors and debugging information are exposed to users, especially in production, without breaking any existing code, logic, workflows, behaviour, UI, or database schema.

Goal

In production, users must never see raw stack traces, framework debug pages, or low-level error messages.

Instead, they should see a generic, user-friendly error page, while detailed error info is logged server-side only.

Requirements

Disable debug mode in production

Ensure the application is not running in debug mode in any production environment.

Use a proper configuration flag or environment variable (e.g. DEBUG = False or equivalent).

Confirm there is a clear separation between:

Development (debug allowed)

Production (debug strictly disabled)

Use generic error pages for users

Implement global error handling for at least:

HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error)

Optionally 404, 403, etc. if applicable

For these errors:

Show a generic, friendly error message/page:

No stack traces

No internal file paths

No database details

No framework/version info

Example message (adapt to app tone):

“An unexpected error occurred. Our team has been notified.”

Log detailed errors internally

Ensure full error details (stack traces, context) are:

Logged to a server log, logging service, or monitoring tool.

Do not expose these details in the browser.

Logging should not change any existing business logic or workflows.

No breaking changes

Do NOT:

Change any existing routes or controller logic.

Modify any business rules or workflows (donations, relief requests, dispatch, approvals, etc.).

Change any database tables, columns, triggers, or data.

Only adjust:

Environment configuration (debug flags)

Global error handling / error pages

Logging configuration (if needed)

Environment-aware behaviour

Use environment variables or config profiles so that:

In development: detailed errors can still be shown to developers.

In production: detailed errors are never shown to users.

Validation / Outcome

After implementation:

Security scans and manual tests must confirm:

No raw stack traces or debug pages are visible from any public URL.

When an error is intentionally triggered in production mode:

User sees only a generic error page.

Detailed error information is available only in server logs.

All existing features, pages, and workflows continue to function exactly as before.

Use this to harden error handling and hide debug info in production without breaking anything in the DMIS/DRIMS application.

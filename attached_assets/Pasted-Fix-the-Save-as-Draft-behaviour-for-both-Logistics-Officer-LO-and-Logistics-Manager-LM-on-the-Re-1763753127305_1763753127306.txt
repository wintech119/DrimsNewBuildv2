Fix the Save as Draft behaviour for both Logistics Officer (LO) and Logistics Manager (LM) on the Relief Fulfillment / Prepare Relief Package pages.

Problem

The “Save as Draft” button is currently behaving like “Submit for Approval”:

Clicking Save as Draft ends up submitting the package for approval and moving it into the Awaiting Approval flow.

This is wrong for both LO and LM.

Required Behaviour

Save as Draft – LO

When the LO clicks Save as Draft:

The system must:

Persist all current allocations, statuses, and changes as a draft.

Keep the package in the “Being Prepared” / draft state for the LO (and LM, if applicable).

Must NOT:

Change the status to “Awaiting Approval”.

Create any entry in the LM’s Awaiting Approval tab/queue.

Send any submit/approval notifications.

After Save as Draft:

The LO (and LM) must be able to reopen the package from the Being Prepared tab and continue editing.

Save as Draft – LM

When the LM is adjusting allocations on the Approve/Prepare pages and clicks Save as Draft:

The system must:

Save all LM changes as a draft.

Keep the package in Awaiting LM Approval / Being Prepared by LM (not approved/ready for dispatch).

Must NOT:

Mark the package as approved.

Move it to Approved for Dispatch.

Notify Inventory Clerk.

After Save as Draft:

The LM must be able to return later, reopen the package, and continue editing before final approval.

Submit / Approve must remain separate

Only the explicit actions (e.g. “Submit for Approval” for LO, “Approve and Dispatch” for LM) should:

Change workflow status to Awaiting LM Approval or Ready for Dispatch.

Trigger notifications and move the package into the relevant approval/dispatch queues.

Save as Draft must never trigger these flows.

Constraints

Do not change any database schema (no new columns, no modified types).

Do not break or alter the existing approval/disptach workflows; only correct the Save as Draft button behaviour and routing.

Ensure Save as Draft works consistently for both LO and LM and is clearly separated from any submission/approval logic.

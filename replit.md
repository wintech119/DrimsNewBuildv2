# DRIMS - Disaster Relief Inventory Management System

## Overview
DRIMS (Disaster Relief Inventory Management System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the entire lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. This includes inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses. The system aims to ensure compliance with government processes, support disaster event coordination, supply allocation, and provide robust user administration with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Its core purpose is to deliver a modern, efficient, and user-friendly solution for disaster preparedness and response, emphasizing security and comprehensive management capabilities such as inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, and reporting.

## Recent Changes (November 20, 2025)
- **Navigation Consolidation**: Removed duplicate "Create Relief Requests" menu item. Retained single "Create Request (On Behalf of Agency)" option accessible to all authorized users (both logistics and agency roles).
- **Multi-Role Request Creation**: Updated `packaging.create_request_on_behalf` to support both LOGISTICS users (select any agency) and AGENCY users (auto-bound to their own agency).
- **Template Enhancements**: Updated create request template with conditional rendering based on user type - logistics users see agency dropdown, agency users see read-only agency field.
- **Dashboard Fixes**: Corrected Item model column references in inventory dashboard (`reorder_level` → `reorder_qty`). Removed inventory value calculation due to absence of cost data in schema.
- **Donation Intake Form Updates**: 
  - Enforced 2 decimal places max for quantity fields (Usable, Defective, Expired), removed spinner arrows from all numeric inputs, added Unit Cost 8.2 format cap (max 99,999,999.99) with JavaScript validation.
  - Implemented dynamic usable quantity adjustment: Usable Qty auto-calculates in real-time as `Donated Qty - Defective - Expired` when defective/expired values change. Field is read-only with visual indication (light gray background).
  - Updated validation rules on form to clearly reflect dynamic field behavior.
- **Phone Number Field Standardization**: Aligned phone number field format between Creating Agency and Creating Donor forms. Both now use `phone-mask.js` for consistent formatting with pattern `+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX`. Applied to both create and edit templates.
- **Database Schema Fix**: Created missing `transfer_item` table that was dropped in migration 007 but never recreated. Added all required columns including `reason_text` to match the TransferItem model. Fixed issue preventing item status changes (activate/inactivate) and UOM detail page errors. Migration 008 applied successfully with subsequent column addition.
- **Processed Donation Protection**: Implemented complete protection against editing processed donations (status 'P'). Added server-side validation to prevent editing, adding items, or deleting processed donations since they're already in warehouse inventory. Updated view template to hide all edit/delete buttons and display lock icon for processed donations. Ensures data integrity by preventing modifications to donations that have been integrated into the warehouse system.

## User Preferences
- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language.
- **UI/UX Requirements**:
  - All pages MUST have consistent look and feel with Relief Package preparation pages
  - Modern, polished design with summary cards, filter tabs, and clean layouts
  - Easy to use and user-friendly across all features
  - Consistent navigation patterns throughout the application

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask 3.0.3
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.32 with Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login 0.6.3 with Werkzeug
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendering with Jinja2, Bootstrap 5.3.3, Bootstrap Icons
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.2.2

### System Design
The application employs a modular blueprint architecture with a database-first approach, built upon a pre-existing ODPEM `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema. Key architectural decisions and features include:
-   **UI/UX Design**: Emphasizes a consistent modern UI, comprehensive design system, shared Jinja2 components, GOJ branding, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and standardized workflow patterns. It features role-specific dashboards and complete management modules for various entities with CRUD operations, validation, and optimistic locking.
-   **Notification System**: Includes real-time in-app notifications with badge counters, offcanvas panels, deep-linking, read/unread tracking, and bulk operations.
-   **Donation Processing**: Manages the full workflow for donations, including intake, verification, batch-level tracking, expiry date management, and integration with warehouse inventory.
-   **Database Architecture**: Based on a 40-table ODPEM schema, ensuring data consistency, auditability, precision, and optimistic locking. Features an enhanced `public.user` table, a new `itembatch` table for batch-level inventory (FEFO/FIFO), and a composite primary key for the `inventory` table.
-   **Data Flow Patterns**: Supports an end-to-end AIDMGMT Relief Workflow, role-based dashboards, two-tier inventory management, eligibility approval, and package fulfillment with batch-level editing capabilities.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented through a centralized feature registry, dynamic navigation, security decorators, smart routing based on primary roles, and a defined role hierarchy. Features secure user management with role assignment restrictions to prevent privilege escalation: CUSTODIAN users can manage operational users but cannot assign administrative roles (SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR, SYS_ADMIN); includes both client-side role filtering and server-side validation to prevent bypass attacks.
- **Timezone Standardization**: All datetime operations, database timestamps, audit trails, and user-facing displays use Jamaica Standard Time (UTC-05:00) consistently.

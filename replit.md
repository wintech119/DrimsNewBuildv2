# DRIMS - Disaster Relief Inventory Management System

## Overview
DRIMS (Disaster Relief Inventory Management System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the entire lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. This includes inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses. The system aims to ensure compliance with government processes, support disaster event coordination, supply allocation, and provide robust user administration with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Its core purpose is to deliver a modern, efficient, and user-friendly solution for disaster preparedness and response, emphasizing security and comprehensive management capabilities such as inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, and reporting.

## Recent Changes (2025-11-20)
- **FEFO/FIFO Batch Limiting (Complete)**: Updated the Select Batches drawer to show only the top 3 batches for FEFO and FIFO items, reducing clutter while maintaining visibility of the most critical batches. Implementation: Modified `get_limited_batches_for_drawer` method in `batch_allocation_service.py` (lines 354-371) to display the top 3 batches in priority order (earliest expiry for FEFO, earliest batch date for FIFO), always including previously allocated batches for editing. If the top 3 batches cannot fulfill the remaining quantity, additional batches are shown until the quantity can be fulfilled, ensuring users can always complete allocations. LIFO items retain per-warehouse limiting behavior. This provides a focused view of the most important batches while ensuring users can still edit existing allocations and fulfill requests.
- **Inventory Clerk Notification Fix (Complete)**: Fixed issue where Inventory Clerks were not receiving notifications when Logistics Managers approved packages for dispatch. Problem: The `create_package_approved_notification` method in `notification_service.py` was checking for LOGISTICS_OFFICER and LOGISTICS_MANAGER roles but not treating INVENTORY_CLERK as a logistics user, causing them to be categorized as agency users with incorrect deep-links. Fix: Updated notification logic (lines 319-333) to specifically check for INVENTORY_CLERK role first and provide them with appropriate notifications linking to the "Awaiting Dispatch" page with message: "Package for {tracking_no} from {agency_name} approved by {approver_name}. Ready to be handed over to agency." Now Inventory Clerks receive timely notifications when packages are approved and ready for handover.
- **Partial Allocation Validation Fix (Complete)**: Fixed critical bug where Logistics Officers couldn't submit packages for dispatch when items were set to "Allowed Limit" (L) or "Partly Filled" (P) status. Issue: The validation logic only allowed partial allocation for unavailability statuses (U, D, W) but rejected L and P statuses even though they're designed for partial fulfillment scenarios. Fix: Updated `_process_allocations` function in `app/features/packaging.py` to expand the `partial_allocation_statuses` set to include 'L' (Allowed Limit) and 'P' (Partly Filled) alongside unavailability statuses. Now Logistics Officers can successfully submit relief packages with items marked as "Allowed Limit" with a reason, enabling proper handling of partial fulfillment scenarios while maintaining full validation for items that should be fully allocated.
- **Batch Selection Drawer UI Refinement (Complete)**: Significantly improved the Select Batches side drawer on Prepare Relief Package page with highly compact, scannable layout for maximum screen efficiency. Changes: (1) **Minimized Vertical Spacing** - Aggressively reduced padding throughout: warehouse headers (1.5rem → 0.625rem/0.875rem), batch items (1.5rem → 0.625rem), warehouse body (1.5rem → 0.625rem), section margins (1.5rem → 0.75rem), and batch header margins (0.625rem → 0.375rem). (2) **Optimized Column Spacing** - Tightened gaps in batch details grid (1rem → 0.375rem/0.5rem) and batch body spacing (0.75rem → 0.5rem) for maximum information density. (3) **Improved Typography Hierarchy** - Warehouse names sized down (1.125rem → 1rem) with smaller icons (0.875rem), batch numbers reduced (1rem → 0.875rem), and consistent label/value spacing (0.25rem → 0.125rem) for cleaner alignment. (4) **Compact Input Controls** - Allocation inputs and "Use Max" buttons reduced (1rem padding → 0.625rem/0.75rem, base font → small font) while maintaining usability. Result: Multiple warehouses with numerous batches now fit comfortably on screen without scrolling, dramatically improving workflow efficiency for Logistics Officers. All existing colors, icons, DRIMS branding, collapsible behavior, and FEFO/FIFO logic preserved - CSS/spacing-only changes.
- **Inventory Clerk Access Restrictions (Complete)**: Updated role-based access controls for Inventory Clerks to restrict their access and visibility: (1) **Reports Access Removed** - Removed INVENTORY_CLERK role from all reports features (`reports_main`, `reports_inventory`, `reports_donations`) in Feature Registry. Inventory Clerks no longer see "Reports" in navigation menus or dashboards. (2) **Warehouse-Filtered Inventory** - Modified inventory listing (`/inventory`) to automatically filter inventory based on user's assigned warehouses for INVENTORY_CLERK role. Clerks can only see inventory from warehouses they are assigned to. Warehouse dropdown also filtered to show only assigned warehouses. Other roles (LO, LM, SYSADMIN) continue to see all warehouses. This ensures data isolation and prevents clerks from viewing or accessing inventory from other warehouses.
- **Location Management Removal (Complete)**: Removed the "Manage Locations" functionality from the entire application. Removed: (1) `app/features/locations.py` blueprint with all CRUD routes, (2) `templates/locations/` directory with all location templates, (3) `location_management` feature from Feature Registry, (4) All navigation entries and role-based access controls for location management. The Location table remains in the database schema for future use but is no longer accessible through the application UI.
- **Dispatch Slip UI Modernization (Complete)**: Updated the Dispatch Slip page (`/packaging/dispatch/<package_id>/details`) with a clean, modern design while preserving all existing functionality. Changes include: (1) **Modern Visual Design** - Clean card-based layout with gradient headers, subtle shadows, and improved color scheme matching DRIMS branding. (2) **Organized Sections** - Agency Information, Dispatch Details, Items by Warehouse, and Signature Section all clearly separated with professional styling. (3) **Enhanced UX** - Modern action buttons with hover effects, status badges with icons, color-coded information, and improved table layouts with hover effects. (4) **Print-Optimized** - Professional print layout suitable for official documentation with clean signature block and ODPEM branding footer. (5) **Functionality Preserved** - All buttons ("Print Dispatch Slip", "Mark as Handed Over") work exactly as before with no changes to backend logic, permissions, or routing.

## Recent Changes (2025-11-19)
- **Warehouse-Specific Dispatch Receiving (Complete)**: Implemented comprehensive dispatch receiving workflow for Inventory Clerks with feedback queues for Logistics Officers and Managers. Key features: (1) **Inventory Clerk - Awaiting Dispatch** - New page showing packages approved by LM and dispatched, filtered by clerk's assigned warehouse(s). Displays only items allocated from warehouses the clerk has access to, with summary cards and filter tabs (Awaiting Handover, Completed, All). (2) **Dispatch Details with Print Slip** - Full dispatch details page with print-friendly layout including agency signature section (Received By, Signature, Date). Items grouped by warehouse with batch/lot info and expiry dates. (3) **Mark as Handed Over** - Inventory Clerks can mark packages as handed over to agencies, updating `received_by_id` and `received_dtime` with full audit trail. Action triggers notifications to LO/LM. (4) **LO/LM - Dispatch Received Queue** - New tab showing packages handed over by Inventory Clerks with warehouse information, handover timestamps, and read-only dispatch details with complete audit timeline. (5) **Notifications** - In-app notifications sent to all LO/LM users when Inventory Clerk marks handover, deep-linking to dispatch details. (6) **Feature Registry Integration** - Added `dispatch_awaiting` and `dispatch_received` features with role-based navigation for INVENTORY_CLERK and LOGISTICS_OFFICER/LOGISTICS_MANAGER respectively. All pages maintain consistent DRIMS UI patterns with summary cards, filter tabs, and modern layouts. No database schema changes - uses existing `received_by_id` and `received_dtime` fields in ReliefPkg table.
- **Unavailable Items Approval Support (Complete)**: Updated LM approval workflow to properly handle items marked as Unavailable (U), Denied (D), or Awaiting Availability (W). Key changes: (1) **Approval Logic Update** - LM can now approve packages where all items have zero allocation IF those items have valid unavailability statuses (U, D, W). Previously, approval was blocked when no items had allocated quantities. New validation allows approval when `all_items_unavailable` is true. (2) **Transaction Summary Enhancement** - Added new "Status" column to transaction summary report showing item fulfillment status with color coding (red for U/D/W, green for Filled, yellow for Partly Filled, cyan for Allowed Limit). Items with zero allocation now clearly show "No allocation made" in batch details section. Status reason displayed below status when provided. (3) **Model Relationship** - Added `item_status` relationship to ReliefRqstItem model (ForeignKey to reliefrqstitem_status table) to enable eager loading of status descriptions. No database schema changes required - only ORM relationship definition updated. (4) **Validation Fix for LO Submission** - Updated `_process_allocations` function to check item status before enforcing complete allocation requirement. Items with U/D/W status can now have zero allocation and be submitted for approval. This ensures agencies receive proper documentation even when items cannot be allocated, maintaining transparency in disaster relief operations.
- **Ready to Dispatch Tab Removal (Complete)**: Removed "Ready for Dispatch" tab and all associated data from Pending Fulfillment page. Removed summary card from metrics, removed filter tab, removed backend logic, and removed all count calculations. Page now shows only: "Awaiting to be Filled", "Being Prepared", "Awaiting Approval" (LM only), and "All" tabs.

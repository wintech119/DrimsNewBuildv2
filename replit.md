# DRIMS - Disaster Relief Inventory Management System

## Overview
DRIMS (Disaster Relief Inventory Management System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the entire lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. This includes inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses. The system aims to ensure compliance with government processes, support disaster event coordination, supply allocation, and provide robust user administration with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Its core purpose is to deliver a modern, efficient, and user-friendly solution for disaster preparedness and response, emphasizing security and comprehensive management capabilities such as inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, and reporting.

## Recent Changes (2025-11-20)
- **Menu Reorganization - Disaster Events (Complete)**: Moved the "Disaster Events" menu item under the "Management" section for better organization. Change: Updated `navigation_group` from `'relief_requests'` to `'master_data'` in the feature registry (line 309, `app/core/feature_registry.py`). The "Disaster Events" feature now appears in the Management menu alongside other master data items like Manage Warehouses, Item Categories, Manage Agencies, etc. This provides a more logical grouping as Disaster Events is a master data management function accessible to CUSTODIAN role.
- **Receive Inventory Feature Removal (Complete)**: Removed the "Receive Inventory" functionality from the entire system. Changes: (1) **Feature Registry** - Removed the `inventory_intake` feature entry from `app/core/feature_registry.py`, which was previously accessible to LOGISTICS_OFFICER, LOGISTICS_MANAGER, INVENTORY_CLERK, and SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR roles. (2) **Navigation** - The "Receive Inventory" menu item no longer appears in any user's navigation menus. (3) **Dashboard Widgets** - Removed `pending_intake_widget` dashboard widget reference. (4) **Access Control** - No users or roles can now access the `/intake/list` route or related intake functionality. Note: The underlying intake blueprint and templates remain in the codebase but are inaccessible through the UI due to feature registry removal. Result: "Receive Inventory" functionality is completely hidden from all users and roles in the system.

## User Preferences
- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language.
- **UI/UX Requirements**:
  - All pages MUST have consistent look and feel with Relief Package preparation pages
  - Modern, polished design with summary cards, filter tabs, and clean layouts
  - Easy to use and user-friendly across all features
  - Consistent navigation patterns throughout the application

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask 3.0.3
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.32 with Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login 0.6.3 with Werkzeug
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendering with Jinja2, Bootstrap 5.3.3, Bootstrap Icons
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.2.2

### System Design
The application employs a modular blueprint architecture with a database-first approach, built upon a pre-existing ODPEM `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema. Key architectural decisions and features include:
-   **UI/UX Design**: Emphasizes a consistent modern UI, comprehensive design system, shared Jinja2 components, GOJ branding, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and standardized workflow patterns. It features role-specific dashboards and complete management modules for various entities with CRUD operations, validation, and optimistic locking.
-   **Notification System**: Includes real-time in-app notifications with badge counters, offcanvas panels, deep-linking, read/unread tracking, and bulk operations.
-   **Donation Processing**: Manages the full workflow for donations, including intake, verification, batch-level tracking, expiry date management, and integration with warehouse inventory.
-   **Database Architecture**: Based on a 40-table ODPEM schema, ensuring data consistency, auditability, precision, and optimistic locking. Features an enhanced `public.user` table, a new `itembatch` table for batch-level inventory (FEFO/FIFO), and a composite primary key for the `inventory` table.
-   **Data Flow Patterns**: Supports an end-to-end AIDMGMT Relief Workflow, role-based dashboards, two-tier inventory management, eligibility approval, and package fulfillment with batch-level editing capabilities.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented through a centralized feature registry, dynamic navigation, security decorators, smart routing based on primary roles, and a defined role hierarchy.

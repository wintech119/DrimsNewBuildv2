# DRIMS - Disaster Relief Inventory Management System

## Overview
DRIMS (Disaster Relief Inventory Management System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the entire lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. This includes inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses. The system aims to ensure compliance with government processes, support disaster event coordination, supply allocation, and provide robust user administration with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Its core purpose is to deliver a modern, efficient, and user-friendly solution for disaster preparedness and response, emphasizing security and comprehensive management capabilities such as inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, and reporting.

## Recent Changes (November 21, 2025)
- **Batch Drawer Warehouse and Batch Filtering Logic**: Implemented strict warehouse and batch filtering rules for the batch selection drawer to ensure proper FEFO/FIFO ordering:
  - **Warehouse Filtering**: Drawer only displays warehouses where the item's total (usable_qty - reserved_qty) > 0
  - **Batch Filtering**: Within each warehouse, only batches with (usable_qty - reserved_qty) > 0 are shown
  - **Per-Warehouse Sorting**: Created new `sort_batches_for_drawer()` method that ignores `item.issuance_order` and sorts based solely on `can_expire_flag`:
    - If `can_expire_flag = TRUE`: Sort by earliest expiry_date first, then oldest batch_date (FEFO)
    - If `can_expire_flag = FALSE`: Sort by oldest batch_date (FIFO)
  - **Early Stopping**: For each warehouse independently, stops loading batches once that warehouse's cumulative available quantity meets or exceeds the remaining requested quantity
  - **No Cross-Warehouse Ordering**: Each warehouse maintains its own independent FEFO/FIFO sort order
  - This ensures consistent, predictable batch selection regardless of how items are configured in the system
- **Fixed Select Batches Button JavaScript Escaping**: Corrected JavaScript syntax error in "Select Batches" button onclick handler by using `| tojson` filter to properly escape item descriptions. Previously, item names containing special characters (like single quotes in "Infant's Formula") would break the JavaScript and prevent the batch drawer from opening.
- **Fixed SQL Type Mismatch in Dashboard**: Changed dashboard filter queries from `filter_by(status_code=...)` to `filter(ReliefRqst.status_code == ...)` to avoid column ambiguity when both ReliefRqst and ReliefPkg tables are joined (both have status_code columns with different data types).
- **Proper Package Lifecycle State Transitions in Approved for Dispatch Tab**: Fixed filtering logic in "Approved for Dispatch" and "Approved (No Allocation)" tabs to exclude packages that have been handed over by Inventory Officers. Both tabs now filter for packages with status='D' (PKG_STATUS_DISPATCHED) AND received_dtime=NULL, ensuring packages disappear from these tabs once the handover is complete (status='C' or received_dtime set). This maintains accurate workflow visibility where LOs only see packages still awaiting handover, not those already completed.
- **Accurate Dashboard for Logistics Officers**: Updated the logistics dashboard to properly filter data based on user role. Logistics Officers now see only relief requests they're involved with (created, fulfilling, or managing packages for), with accurate counts reflecting their own work. Logistics Managers continue to see global counts and all requests for supervisory oversight. This aligns dashboard visibility with the established pattern used in the relief package workflow, ensuring data isolation and proper hierarchical visibility.
- **Read-Only UI Enforcement for LOs After Package Submission**: Implemented read-only mode for Logistics Officers when viewing packages that have been submitted to Logistics Managers for approval. The system uses relief request status to distinguish draft packages (STATUS_SUBMITTED, editable) from submitted packages (STATUS_PART_FILLED, read-only). When an LO views a submitted package, the UI displays an informational alert, disables all "Select Batches" buttons, disables status dropdowns and reason fields, and hides all action buttons (Save Draft, Submit for Approval, Cancel). This ensures LOs cannot modify packages once submitted to LM for approval, while Logistics Managers retain full edit access throughout the workflow.
- **Fixed Awaiting Approval Tab Filtering for LOs**: Corrected tab filtering logic to ensure packages with "Awaiting Approval" status appear in the correct tab for Logistics Officers instead of showing under "Being Prepared". Fixed `has_pending_approval()` to detect submitted packages by checking relief request status (PART_FILLED) instead of verify_by_id field, since verify_by_id is only set by LM during approval. Updated `is_user_involved()` to include relief request creator check. Tab transitions now correctly reflect workflow states: Draft (SUBMITTED + pkg status='P') → Being Prepared; Submitted (PART_FILLED + pkg status='P') → Awaiting Approval; Approved (pkg status='D') → Approved for Dispatch.
- **Comprehensive Optimistic Locking for Relief Package Workflow**: Implemented full optimistic locking across all relief package preparation and approval workflows to prevent lost updates in multi-user scenarios. Added `_validate_version_nbr()` helper function and integrated version validation in:
  - **Preparation Workflow** (`prepare_package` route): `_save_draft()`, `_submit_for_approval()`, `_send_for_dispatch()` - validates both relief request and package version numbers before any mutations
  - **Approval Workflow** (`approve_package` route): `_save_draft_approval()`, `_approve_and_dispatch()` - validates versions before LM modifications
  - **Templates**: `prepare.html` and `approve.html` now include hidden `version_nbr` fields for both relief request and package
  - **Error Handling**: All OptimisticLockError exceptions are caught and display user-friendly messages ("This [entity] has been updated by another user. Please refresh and try again."), with automatic rollback to prevent partial saves
  - **Multi-user Safety**: Prevents lost updates when multiple users (LO vs LO, LO vs LM, LM vs LM) attempt to modify the same relief request or package simultaneously
- **Submit-Once Guard for Relief Request Approval**: Implemented prevention of duplicate submissions to Logistics Managers. Only one Logistics Officer can submit a relief request for LM approval; subsequent attempts by other LOs are blocked with a clear message: "This relief request has already been submitted to the Logistics Manager for approval by another user." Uses existing `status_code='P'` and `verify_by_id` fields plus `version_nbr` optimistic locking to handle race conditions where multiple LOs attempt simultaneous submission. No database schema changes required.
- **Enhanced Package Visibility for LOs**: Fixed filtering logic in "Approved for Dispatch" and "Approved (No Allocation)" tabs to ensure Logistics Officers can see packages tied to relief requests they created, in addition to packages they directly created or updated. This ensures LOs who create relief requests can see the full lifecycle of those requests through approval and dispatch.
- **Status Dropdown Logic on Prepare Relief Package Page**: Implemented automatic status dropdown behavior based on allocation quantities for both LO and LM roles. The system now enforces three cases: (1) Fully Allocated (Allocated == Requested) automatically sets status to "FILLED" and locks the dropdown as read-only; (2) No Allocation (Allocated == 0) defaults to "UNAVAILABLE" with options for UNAVAILABLE, DENIED, and AWAITING AVAILABILITY; (3) Partially Allocated (0 < Allocated < Requested) defaults to "PARTLY FILLED" with options for PARTLY FILLED and ALLOWED LIMIT. Status and options automatically refresh after closing the batch allocation drawer, ensuring dropdown always reflects current allocation state.
- **Badge Counts Removal**: Removed all queue/badge counts from workflow tabs for all users (both Logistics Officers and Logistics Managers). Tabs now display clean labels without numerical indicators (e.g., "Approved for Dispatch" instead of "Approved for Dispatch (6)"). This simplifies the interface while maintaining the summary cards at the top of each page for key metrics.
- **Awaiting Approval Tab Access for LOs**: Extended "Awaiting Approval" tab access to both Logistics Officers and Logistics Managers. LOs can now view all packages they submitted for approval, while LMs continue to see all packages from all LOs. Updated navigation to show the tab and summary card for both roles. This improves workflow visibility and allows LOs to track their submitted packages through the approval process.
- **Comprehensive Status Dropdown Logic for Relief Package Preparation**: Implemented full allocation-activity-aware status dropdown behavior for the Prepare Relief Package page:
  - **Initial Load (Before Any Allocation)**: When page first loads and no drawer activity has occurred (no ReliefPkgItem records exist for the item), status defaults to "REQUESTED" with options [REQUESTED, UNAVAILABLE, DENIED, AWAITING AVAILABILITY]. Users can manually change status even before allocation.
  - **After Allocation Activity (Drawer Opened/Saved)**: Once drawer has been used for an item (ReliefPkgItem record exists, even with qty=0), the status logic changes:
    - **No Allocation (Allocated == 0)**: Defaults to "UNAVAILABLE" with options [UNAVAILABLE, DENIED, AWAITING AVAILABILITY]. REQUESTED is no longer available.
    - **Fully Allocated (Allocated == Requested)**: Status set to "FILLED" with dropdown locked (read-only), showing only [FILLED].
    - **Partially Allocated (0 < Allocated < Requested)**: Defaults to "PARTLY FILLED" with options [PARTLY FILLED, ALLOWED LIMIT].
  - **Persistent Activity Tracking**: Activity flag persists in data attributes and server-side, ensuring correct status behavior across page reloads and even when all allocations are cleared.
  - **Automatic Refresh**: Status dropdown and options automatically update after closing the batch allocation drawer, always reflecting current allocation state.

### System Design
The application employs a modular blueprint architecture with a database-first approach, built upon a pre-existing ODPEM `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema. Key architectural decisions and features include:
-   **UI/UX Design**: Emphasizes a consistent modern UI, comprehensive design system, shared Jinja2 components, GOJ branding, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and standardized workflow patterns. It features role-specific dashboards and complete management modules for various entities with CRUD operations, validation, and optimistic locking.
-   **Notification System**: Includes real-time in-app notifications with badge counters, offcanvas panels, deep-linking, read/unread tracking, and bulk operations.
-   **Donation Processing**: Manages the full workflow for donations, including intake, verification, batch-level tracking, expiry date management, and integration with warehouse inventory.
-   **Database Architecture**: Based on a 40-table ODPEM schema, ensuring data consistency, auditability, precision, and optimistic locking. Features an enhanced `public.user` table, a new `itembatch` table for batch-level inventory (FEFO/FIFO), and a composite primary key for the `inventory` table.
-   **Data Flow Patterns**: Supports an end-to-end AIDMGMT Relief Workflow, role-based dashboards, two-tier inventory management, eligibility approval, and package fulfillment with batch-level editing capabilities.
-   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented through a centralized feature registry, dynamic navigation, security decorators, smart routing based on primary roles, and a defined role hierarchy. Features secure user management with role assignment restrictions to prevent privilege escalation: CUSTODIAN users can manage operational users but cannot assign administrative roles (SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR, SYS_ADMIN); includes both client-side role filtering and server-side validation to prevent bypass attacks.
- **Timezone Standardization**: All datetime operations, database timestamps, audit trails, and user-facing displays use Jamaica Standard Time (UTC-05:00) consistently.

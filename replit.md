# DRIMS - Disaster Relief Inventory Management System

## Overview
DRIMS (Disaster Relief Inventory Management System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the full lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. It aims to streamline inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses, ensuring compliance with government processes. The system supports disaster event coordination, supply allocation, user administration with RBAC, and comprehensive management of various entities, inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, and reporting. The project's ambition is to provide a modern, efficient, and user-friendly system for disaster preparedness and response, ensuring robust security features.

## Recent Changes (2025-11-18)
- **LM Notification Bug Fix**: Fixed critical bug where Logistics Managers were not receiving notifications when Logistics Officers submitted packages for approval. Root cause: role code mismatch - code was searching for 'LOGISTICS_MANAGER' but actual role code in database is 'LM'. Fix: Updated notification service call to use correct role code 'LM'. Added detailed logging to track notification creation for debugging.
- **Approve Relief Package Workflow - Fully Prefilled with Real-Time UI Updates**: Updated LM approval workflow to be fully driven by LO's prepared allocations with real-time UI updates. When LM opens approval page, all data loads from LO's prepared package including requested items, per-warehouse/per-batch allocations, statuses, and totals. Batch drawer pre-populates with LO's batch-level allocations for editing. LM can either "Approve and Dispatch" to accept as-is or adjust allocations before approving. Implementation: backend loads batch-level data from relief_pkg.items, passes to template as existing_batch_allocations, template renders hidden inputs (batch_allocation_{itemId}_{batchId}) that batch drawer JavaScript reads on initialization. Visual indicators: green "View/Edit Batches" button with batch count badge and warehouse count for pre-filled items, gray outline "Select Batches" button for empty items. Real-time updates: when LM edits batch selections in drawer and clicks Apply, updateMainPageDisplay() automatically updates Allocated column, Remaining column, Status dropdown (auto-selects A=Approved if fully allocated, P=Partially Approved if partial, respects allowed codes), and button badge/warehouse count.
- **Approve Relief Package Workflow Foundation**: Implemented complete LM approval workflow with approve_package route (LM-only access), approve.html template reusing prepare.html UI/UX, batch drawer integration for allocation adjustments with FEFO/FIFO rules, Save Draft functionality with delta-based inventory reservation updates, Approve & Dispatch action updating issue_qty and notifying Inventory Clerk, optimistic locking for concurrency control, corrected navigation links (pending_approval queue), and duplicate notification prevention checking package status before processing allocations
- **Relief Request Full Workflow Access for LM/LO**: Extended complete relief request workflow permissions to LOGISTICS_MANAGER and LOGISTICS_OFFICER roles - create, view, edit, add/edit items, submit, cancel all requests
- **Smart Routing Logic**: Pure logistics users (without agency_id) redirected to "create on behalf" route with agency selector; after cancel redirected to packaging fulfillment
- **Dual-Role Support**: Users with both logistics and agency roles can create requests for their own agency using standard form and access all requests via logistics role
- **Dynamic Request List View**: Logistics users see all relief requests from all agencies; agency users see only their own agency's requests
- **Prepared Allocations Display**: Fixed Allocated and Remaining columns to display accurate server-calculated values on page load, with dynamic updates after batch drawer use

## User Preferences

- **Workflows**: Standardized 5-step workflow patterns for Agency Relief Requests and Eligibility Approval.
- **Dashboards**: 6 role-specific dashboards with consistent modern UI, filter tabs, and summary cards.
- **Management Modules**: Comprehensive modules for Event, Warehouse, User, Notification, Item, Item Category, Custodian, Unit of Measure, Inventory, and Donation management, all featuring modern UI, CRUD operations, validation, and optimistic locking.
- **Notification System**: Real-time in-app notifications with bell icon badge counter, offcanvas panel, deep-linking to relevant pages, and read/unread tracking. Features: (1) NEW tag displays for unread notifications, (2) Click-to-mark-as-read functionality with optimistic UI updates, (3) Badge count updates immediately before navigation, (4) Event delegation prevents duplicate listeners, (5) Automatic badge refresh every 30 seconds, (6) "Mark All Read" and "Clear All" bulk operations.
- **Donation Processing**: Complete donation workflow including header and item management, status tracking (Entered, Verified, Processed), automatic verification on acceptance, modern UI with summary cards and filter tabs, restricted to LOGISTICS_MANAGER and LOGISTICS_OFFICER roles. Donation creation form uses consistent modern UI pattern matching warehouse management and agency relief request pages, with inline item addition following agency request items edit page interaction pattern. Auto-verification workflow ensures all accepted donations are immediately verified within the same transaction (no separate verification step).
- **Donation Intake Management**: Full workflow for intaking verified donations into warehouse inventory. Features: (1) Select verified donations (status='V') and target warehouse, (2) Batch-level tracking with mandatory batch numbers for batched items, (3) Expiry date management for perishable items, (4) Split quantities (usable, defective, expired), (5) Atomic transaction creates dnintake header/items, itembatch records, updates inventory totals, and marks donation as Processed, (6) Quantity validation ensures intake matches donation exactly (database-sourced), (7) Concurrency control with SELECT FOR UPDATE on inventory, (8) MVP: No updates to existing intakes (prevents duplicate processing), (9) Modern UI with filter tabs, summary cards, and comprehensive validation feedback, (10) Restricted to LOGISTICS_MANAGER and LOGISTICS_OFFICER roles, (11) YYYY-MM-DD date format enforcement via Flatpickr library on all date fields (intake_date, batch_date, expiry_date) with calendar picker functionality and min/max validation, (12) DonationIntake model includes warehouse relationship via explicit primaryjoin for template access to warehouse details, (13) Batch number uniqueness validation prevents duplicate batch numbers for the same item with user-friendly error messages (auto-generated NOBATCH placeholders for non-batched items are excluded from validation).

### Database Architecture
- **Schema**: Based on the authoritative ODPEM `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema (40 tables).
- **Key Design Decisions**:
    - **Data Consistency**: All `varchar` fields in uppercase.
    - **Auditability**: Standard `create_by_id`, `create_dtime`, `version_nbr` on all ODPEM tables.
    - **Precision**: `DECIMAL(15,4)` for quantity fields.
    - **Status Management**: Integer/character codes for entity statuses, with lookup tables.
    - **Optimistic Locking**: Implemented across all 40 tables using SQLAlchemy's `version_id_col`.
    - **User Management**: Enhanced `public.user` table with `user_name`, MFA, lockout, password management, agency linkage, and `citext` for case-insensitive email.
    - **Batch Tracking System**: New `itembatch` table supports batch-level inventory management with FEFO/FIFO allocation rules, integrated with `reliefpkg_item` for mandatory batch-level allocation.
    - **Inventory Table Schema**: Composite primary key (inventory_id, item_id) where inventory_id represents the warehouse_id, supporting batch-level inventory tracking.
    - **Relief Request Status Table**: 10 status codes (0-9) organized into three workflow views with reason requirements for DENIED, CLOSED, and INELIGIBLE statuses.
    - **Relief Package Table**: Tracks relief packages with agency_id, tracking_no (7-char), eligible_event_id, and 6 status codes (A=Draft, P=Processing, C=Completed, V=Verified, D=Dispatched, R=Received).
    - **Atomic Transaction Workflow**: Implemented for donation creation, ensuring header and all items are saved in a single transaction or none at all.
    - **Donation Item Status**: Default value 'V' (Verified) set at database and model level for `donation_item.status_code`, removed from form UI for streamlined user experience.
    - **Auto-Verification on Acceptance (MVP)**: Donations and donation items are automatically verified during the acceptance transaction. `verify_by_id` and `verify_dtime` are set to match `create_by_id` and `create_dtime`. Donation headers receive status 'V' (Verified) on creation. No separate verification workflow or UI elements exist in MVP. All updates that pass validation maintain verified status with updated verification timestamps.

### Data Flow Patterns
- **AIDMGMT Relief Workflow**: End-to-end process from request creation to distribution.
- **Dashboards**: Role-based dashboard routing with 6 specialized views.
- **Inventory Management**: Two-tier tracking system: warehouse-level stock and batch-level tracking with FEFO/FIFO allocation.
- **Eligibility Approval Workflow**: Role-based access control and service layer for eligibility decisions.
- **Package Fulfillment Workflow**: Unified `packaging` blueprint with routes for pending fulfillment, package preparation, pending LM approval queue, and package approval with batch-level editing capabilities.
- **Services**: `ItemStatusService`, `InventoryReservationService`, and `BatchAllocationService`.
- **Donation Processing Workflow**: Complete CRUD operations for donation headers and items with status transitions, verification tracking, and inventory integration.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Feature Registry**: Centralized feature-to-role mapping in `app/core/feature_registry.py` (27 features to 10 database roles).
- **Dynamic Navigation System**: Role-based dynamic navigation (`templates/components/_dynamic_navigation.html`).
- **Security Decorators**: Backend route protection decorators (`app/core/decorators.py`).
- **Smart Routing**: Automatic dashboard routing based on user's primary role.
- **Role Priority**: Defined hierarchy from SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR to AGENCY_DISTRIBUTOR/SHELTER.
- **Verified Database Roles**: SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR, LOGISTICS_MANAGER, LOGISTICS_OFFICER, ODPEM_DG, ODPEM_DDG, ODPEM_DIR_PEOD, INVENTORY_CLERK, AGENCY_DISTRIBUTOR, AGENCY_SHELTER, AUDITOR, CUSTODIAN.
- **Master Data RBAC Restrictions**: CRUD operations for Event, Warehouse, Item, ItemCategory, UnitOfMeasure, and Custodian restricted to CUSTODIAN role.
- **Item Management Module**: Full CRUD for relief items restricted to CUSTODIAN role.
- **Automatic Batch Creation**: Batches are automatically created during inventory intake processes for items with `is_batched_flag=TRUE` via `BatchCreationService`.

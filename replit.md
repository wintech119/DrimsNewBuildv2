# DRIMS - Disaster Relief Inventory Management System

## Overview
DRIMS (Disaster Relief Inventory Management System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the full lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. It ensures compliance with government processes using the `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema. The system streamlines inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses, supporting disaster event coordination and supply allocation. It includes user administration with RBAC, donor/agency/custodian management, inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, reporting, and robust security features.

## User Preferences
- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language.
- **UI/UX Requirements**:

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask 3.0.3
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.32 with Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login 0.6.3 with Werkzeug
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendering with Jinja2, Bootstrap 5.3.3, Bootstrap Icons
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.2.2

### Application Structure
- **Modular Blueprint Architecture**: Feature-specific blueprints under `app/features/`.
- **Database-First Approach**: SQLAlchemy models (`app/db/models.py`) map to a pre-existing ODPEM `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema.
- **Shared Utilities**: Located in `app/core/`.
- **Templates**: Jinja2 templates (`templates/`) enforce Government of Jamaica (GOJ) branding.

### UI/UX Design
All pages maintain a modern, consistent UI with a comprehensive design system:
- **Modern Design System** (`modern-ui.css`): Foundation with 50+ CSS custom properties for colors (primary greens, semantic colors, neutrals, tinted backgrounds), spacing (0.25rem to 2.5rem), typography (9 font sizes, 4 weights), shadows (5 levels), border radius values, and z-index scale. Includes complete component library with metric cards, filter tabs, modern tables, buttons (6 variants + sizes), status badges, alerts, forms, empty states, loading spinners, and login page components.
- **Consistent Styling**: Modern UI standard with summary metric cards, filter tabs, modern tables (`modern-table`), standardized action buttons (`btn-modern`, `btn-primary`, `btn-outline`), color-coded status badges (`status-badge-success`, `status-badge-warning`), code/SKU pills (`code-pill`), and clean page layouts (`page-container`, `page-header-modern`).
- **Shared Components**: Reusable Jinja2 macros for status badges, summary cards, and a unified workflow progress sidebar (`_workflow_progress.html`). All components use design tokens for maintainability.
- **Styling**: Uses `modern-ui.css` (foundation), `relief-requests-ui.css`, `notifications-ui.css`, `user-management-ui.css`, and `workflow-sidebar.css` for feature-specific enhancements.
- **Responsiveness**: Fixed header, collapsible sidebar, dynamic content margins, responsive grid layouts with Bootstrap 5.3.3.
- **Branding**: GOJ branding with primary green (#009639) and gold accent (#FDB913), official Jamaica Coat of Arms and ODPEM logos, consistent across all pages.
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with focus-visible states, proper color contrast (4.5:1 for text), ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and screen reader support.
- **Workflows**: Standardized 5-step workflow patterns for Agency Relief Requests and Eligibility Approval.
- **Package Fulfillment Workflow**: Modern UI with real-time calculations, multi-warehouse allocation (filtered to show only warehouses with active stock for each item), dynamic item status validation, and inventory reservation.
- **Dashboard System**: 6 role-specific dashboards with consistent modern UI, filter tabs, summary cards, and optimized queries.
- **User Management**: Complete modern redesign with metrics dashboard (6 summary cards), filter tabs (All/Active/Inactive/Locked/No MFA/Admin), real-time search, sortable tables, tabbed user profiles (Identity/Roles/Security/Activity), single-page create/edit forms with validation, security indicators, compliance alerts, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility features. Uses efficient single-page form pattern for experienced administrators.
- **Notification Management**: Modern UI redesign with 6 metric cards (Total/Unread/Read/Today/This Week/Low Stock), filter tabs with real-time JavaScript filtering, reusable Jinja2 macros (_macros.html) for notification cards and icons, dedicated CSS (notifications-ui.css) matching established design patterns, offcanvas bell dropdown with AJAX loading, clear all modal with confirmation, individual delete functionality with smooth animations, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility. Notification view precomputes metric counts server-side for performance.

### Database Architecture
- **Schema**: Based on the authoritative ODPEM `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema (40 tables).
- **Key Design Decisions**:
    - **Data Consistency**: All `varchar` fields in uppercase.
    - **Auditability**: `create_by_id`, `create_dtime`, `version_nbr` standard on all ODPEM tables.
    - **Precision**: `DECIMAL(15,4)` for quantity fields.
    - **Status Management**: Integer/character codes for entity statuses, with lookup tables.
    - **Optimistic Locking**: Implemented across all 40 tables using SQLAlchemy's `version_id_col`.
    - **User Management**: Enhanced `public.user` table with MFA, lockout, password management, agency linkage, and `citext` for case-insensitive email.
    - **New Workflows**: `agency_account_request` and `agency_account_request_audit` tables for account creation workflows.

### Data Flow Patterns
- **AIDMGMT Relief Workflow**: End-to-end process from request creation (agencies) to eligibility review (ODPEM directors), package preparation (logistics), and distribution.
- **Dashboards**: Role-based dashboard routing with 6 specialized views (Logistics, Agency, Director, Admin, Inventory, General). Main dashboard (`/`) automatically routes users based on primary role.
- **Inventory Management**: Tracks stock by warehouse and item in the `inventory` table, including `usable_qty`, `reserved_qty`, `defective_qty`, `expired_qty`, with bin-level tracking.
- **Eligibility Approval Workflow**: Role-based access control (RBAC) and service layer for eligibility decisions.
- **Package Fulfillment Workflow**: Unified `packaging` blueprint with routes for pending fulfillment and package preparation. Includes features like summary metric cards, multi-warehouse allocation, dynamic item status validation, and a 4-step workflow sidebar.
- **Services**: `ItemStatusService` for status validation and `InventoryReservationService` for transaction-safe inventory reservation.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- **Feature Registry**: Centralized feature-to-role mapping in `app/core/feature_registry.py` with 26 features mapped to 10 verified database role codes.
- **Dynamic Navigation System**: Role-based dynamic navigation (`templates/components/_dynamic_navigation.html`) adapts to user permissions, showing only accessible features.
- **Security Decorators**: Backend route protection decorators (`app/core/decorators.py`) for single, any, or all feature access control.
- **Smart Routing**: Automatic dashboard routing based on user's primary role.
- **Role Priority**: SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR > ODPEM_DG/DDG/DIR_PEOD > LOGISTICS_MANAGER > LOGISTICS_OFFICER > INVENTORY_CLERK > AGENCY_DISTRIBUTOR/SHELTER.
- **Verified Database Roles**: SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR, LOGISTICS_MANAGER, LOGISTICS_OFFICER, ODPEM_DG, ODPEM_DDG, ODPEM_DIR_PEOD, INVENTORY_CLERK, AGENCY_DISTRIBUTOR, AGENCY_SHELTER, AUDITOR.

# DRIMS - Disaster Relief Inventory Management System

## Overview
DRIMS (Disaster Relief Inventory Management System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the entire lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. This includes inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses. The system aims to ensure compliance with government processes, support disaster event coordination, supply allocation, and provide robust user administration with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Its core purpose is to deliver a modern, efficient, and user-friendly solution for disaster preparedness and response, emphasizing security and comprehensive management capabilities such as inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, and reporting.

## Recent Changes (2025-11-20)
- **System-wide Timezone Standardization to Jamaica Time (Complete)**: Implemented comprehensive timezone standardization across the entire DRIMS application to use Jamaica Standard Time (UTC-05:00) consistently. Changes: (1) **Timezone Utility Module** - Created `app/utils/timezone.py` with helper functions: `now()` for current Jamaica time, `get_date_only()` for date boundaries, `format_datetime()` for consistent display formatting, and `datetime_to_jamaica()` for converting UTC to Jamaica time. (2) **Database Layer** - Updated all database model methods and datetime operations to use Jamaica time instead of UTC. (3) **Application Layer** - Replaced all `datetime.utcnow()` calls with `now()` from timezone utility across all feature blueprints (dashboard, packaging, notifications, warehouse, inventory, relief requests, intake, transfers, donors, agencies, items, events, reports, locations) and service modules (notification_service, fulfillment_lock_service, batch_creation_service, inventory_reservation_service). (4) **Settings** - Added `DEFAULT_TIMEZONE = 'America/Jamaica'` to settings.py for application-wide configuration. (5) **Template Filters** - Added `format_datetime` and `format_date` Jinja2 template filters in drims_app.py for consistent datetime display in templates. (6) **Context Processor** - Updated `inject_now()` context processor to use Jamaica time for footer and templates. Result: All datetime operations, database timestamps, audit trails, and user-facing displays now use Jamaica Standard Time (UTC-05:00) consistently throughout DRIMS. This ensures accurate local time representation for ODPEM operations and eliminates timezone confusion.
- **General Dashboard Modernization (Complete)**: Completely redesigned the General Dashboard with modern, engaging UI matching the quality of role-specific dashboards. Changes: (1) **Welcome Banner** - Added beautiful gradient welcome banner with Government of Jamaica green colors (#009639), user name, and role display with subtle animation effects. (2) **Interactive Feature Cards** - Redesigned feature cards with hover effects, gradient icon backgrounds, arrow indicators, and improved information hierarchy. Features are now displayed in a responsive 3-column grid (12 features max) with clickable card links. (3) **Removed Quick Actions** - Eliminated the Quick Actions section for consistency with Logistics and other dashboards - all functionality accessible through main navigation. (4) **Help Section** - Added help and support card at the bottom with contact information. (5) **Visual Polish** - Implemented modern spacing, typography, rounded corners (12px), smooth transitions, and professional color scheme. Template: `templates/dashboard/general.html`. Result: General Dashboard now provides an engaging, feature-rich landing experience for users without specific role dashboards, with consistent modern UI throughout DRIMS.
- **Logo Link & Old Dashboard Redirect (Complete)**: Fixed DRIMS logo and home route to redirect to role-based dashboards instead of the old dashboard with custodian-only quick actions. Changes: (1) Updated DRIMS logo link in `templates/base.html` from `url_for('index')` to `url_for('dashboard.index')` to ensure clicking the logo takes users to their role-appropriate dashboard. (2) Modified the `/` route in `drims_app.py` to redirect to `dashboard.index` instead of rendering the old `templates/index.html` which contained quick actions for New Event, New Warehouse, New Item - all custodian-only functions. (3) Updated login redirect to use `dashboard.index`. Result: Users clicking the DRIMS logo now always go to their proper role-based dashboard (Logistics, Agency, Director, etc.) instead of the old dashboard with inappropriate quick actions.
- **Logistics Dashboard Cleanup (Complete)**: Removed the "Quick Actions" section from the Logistics Officer dashboard (`templates/dashboard/logistics.html`). The quick actions were redundant with existing page header buttons and navigation menu items. Logistics Officers can still access all functionality through the main navigation and "View All Fulfillment" button in the page header.
- **Notification Deep-Linking Update (Complete)**: Updated notification deep-links after menu consolidation to ensure all notifications route users to the correct locations. Changes: (1) **Package Approved Notifications for LOs/LMs** - Now deep-link to the "Approved for Dispatch" tab (`/packaging/pending-fulfillment?filter=approved_for_dispatch`) instead of the preparation page, providing immediate access to approved packages. (2) **Inventory Clerk Notifications** - Continue to link to the awaiting dispatch page for warehouse-specific handover. (3) **Agency User Notifications** - Link to request tracking page. All notification deep-links verified to work correctly after removing standalone menu items.
- **Menu Consolidation - Approve Packages Removed (Complete)**: Removed the duplicate "Approve Packages" menu item from the main navigation. Change: Removed the `package_approval` feature entry from `app/core/feature_registry.py` (was on line 186-197) as this functionality is now available as the "Awaiting Approval" tab within the "Relief Fulfillment Packages" page for Logistics Managers. This eliminates duplicate navigation items and provides a more streamlined, integrated workflow where LMs can see the full package lifecycle (Awaiting, In Progress, Awaiting Approval, Approved for Dispatch) within a single page.
- **Approved for Dispatch Tab Integration (Complete)**: Integrated "Approved for Dispatch" as a tab within the "Relief Fulfillment Packages" page instead of a separate menu item. Changes: (1) **Route Update** - Modified `/packaging/pending-fulfillment` route to handle `approved_for_dispatch` filter, which displays approved packages (status='D') instead of requests. (2) **Template Update** - Added "Approved for Dispatch" tab to `templates/packaging/pending_fulfillment.html` with informational alert stating packages shown are approved by LM and dispatched to Inventory Clerks for informational purposes only. (3) **Feature Registry** - Removed `approved_packages_queue` feature entry so it no longer appears as a separate menu item. (4) **Data Display** - Shows package ID, agency, items count, total quantity, approved date, handover status, and view details action. (5) **Transaction Summary Back Link** - Made the back button role-aware: LMs go back to Pending Approval, LOs go back to Approved Packages tab. This provides an integrated view of the full package lifecycle within a single page without cluttering the main navigation menu.
- **Menu Item Rename - Relief Fulfillment Packages (Complete)**: Renamed "Prepare Fulfillment Packages" to "Relief Fulfillment Packages" for better clarity and consistency with DRIMS terminology. Change: Updated the `name` field from `'Prepare Fulfillment Packages'` to `'Relief Fulfillment Packages'` in the `package_preparation` feature entry in `app/core/feature_registry.py` (line 178). This change affects all users and roles (LOGISTICS_OFFICER, LOGISTICS_MANAGER) who use this functionality. The menu item now appears as "Relief Fulfillment Packages" in the navigation menu under the Packaging section.
- **Menu Reorganization - Disaster Events (Complete)**: Moved the "Disaster Events" menu item under the "Management" section for better organization. Change: Updated `navigation_group` from `'relief_requests'` to `'master_data'` in the feature registry (line 309, `app/core/feature_registry.py`). The "Disaster Events" feature now appears in the Management menu alongside other master data items like Manage Warehouses, Item Categories, Manage Agencies, etc. This provides a more logical grouping as Disaster Events is a master data management function accessible to CUSTODIAN role.
- **Receive Inventory Feature Removal (Complete)**: Removed the "Receive Inventory" functionality from the entire system. Changes: (1) **Feature Registry** - Removed the `inventory_intake` feature entry from `app/core/feature_registry.py`, which was previously accessible to LOGISTICS_OFFICER, LOGISTICS_MANAGER, INVENTORY_CLERK, and SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR roles. (2) **Navigation** - The "Receive Inventory" menu item no longer appears in any user's navigation menus. (3) **Dashboard Widgets** - Removed `pending_intake_widget` dashboard widget reference. (4) **Access Control** - No users or roles can now access the `/intake/list` route or related intake functionality. Note: The underlying intake blueprint and templates remain in the codebase but are inaccessible through the UI due to feature registry removal. Result: "Receive Inventory" functionality is completely hidden from all users and roles in the system.

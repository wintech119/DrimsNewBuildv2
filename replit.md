# DMIS - Disaster Management Information System

## Overview
DMIS (Disaster Management Information System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the entire lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. Its core purpose is to provide a modern, efficient, and user-friendly solution for disaster preparedness and response. Key capabilities include inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses, all while ensuring compliance with government processes and supporting disaster event coordination and supply allocation. The system emphasizes security, robust user administration with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, and reporting.

## User Preferences
- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language.
- **UI/UX Requirements**:
  - All pages MUST have consistent look and feel with Relief Package preparation pages
  - Modern, polished design with summary cards, filter tabs, and clean layouts
  - Easy to use and user-friendly across all features
  - Consistent navigation patterns throughout the application

## System Architecture
The application employs a modular blueprint architecture with a database-first approach, built upon a pre-existing ODPEM `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema.

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask 3.0.3
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.32 with Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login 0.6.3 with Werkzeug
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendering with Jinja2, Bootstrap 5.3.3, Bootstrap Icons
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.2.2

### System Design
- **UI/UX Design**: Consistent modern UI, comprehensive design system, shared Jinja2 components, GOJ branding, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and standardized workflow patterns. Features role-specific dashboards and complete management modules with CRUD, validation, and optimistic locking.
- **Notification System**: Real-time in-app notifications with badge counters, offcanvas panels, deep-linking, read/unread tracking, and bulk operations.
- **Donation Processing**: Manages full workflow for donations, including intake, verification, batch-level tracking, expiry dates, and integration with warehouse inventory. Supports full donation workflow with country, currency, and cost breakdowns, including document uploads and robust validation.
- **Database Architecture**: Based on a 40-table ODPEM schema, ensuring data consistency, auditability, precision, and optimistic locking. Includes an enhanced `public.user` table, a new `itembatch` table (FEFO/FIFO), `itemcostdef` for cost types, `donation_doc` for document attachments, and composite primary keys.
- **Data Flow Patterns**: Supports end-to-end AIDMGMT Relief Workflow, role-based dashboards, two-tier inventory management, eligibility approval, and package fulfillment with batch-level editing.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Centralized feature registry, dynamic navigation, security decorators, smart routing, and a defined role hierarchy. Features secure user management with role assignment restrictions and both client-side and server-side validation.
- **Security Features**: Strict nonce-based Content Security Policy (CSP), comprehensive Flask-WTF Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection, secure cookie configuration (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax), Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN assets, global no-cache headers for sensitive pages, HTTP header sanitization, production-safe error handling, email obfuscation, query string protection for sensitive parameters, and robust login authentication.
- **Timezone Standardization**: All datetime operations, database timestamps, audit trails, and user-facing displays use Jamaica Standard Time (UTC-05:00).
- **Key Features**: Universal visibility for approved relief requests, accurate inventory validation, batch-level reservation synchronization for draft packages, and automatic inventory table updates on dispatch. Relief package cancellation includes full reservation rollback using optimistic locking and transactional integrity. Implements robust relief request status management.
- **Dynamic GOODS/FUNDS Donation Workflow**: Donation form dynamically adapts based on item category type (GOODS/FUNDS) via an API endpoint, automatically setting donation type and controlling field editability.

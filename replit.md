# DMIS - Disaster Management Information System

## Overview
DMIS (Disaster Management Information System) is a web-based platform for the Government of Jamaica's ODPEM, designed to manage the entire lifecycle of disaster relief supplies. This includes inventory tracking, donation management, relief request processing, and distribution across multiple warehouses. The system aims to ensure compliance with government processes, support disaster event coordination, supply allocation, and provide robust user administration with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). Its core purpose is to deliver a modern, efficient, and user-friendly solution for disaster preparedness and response, emphasizing security and comprehensive management capabilities such as inventory transfers, location tracking, analytics, and reporting.

## User Preferences
- **Communication style**: Simple, everyday language.
- **UI/UX Requirements**:
  - All pages MUST have consistent look and feel with Relief Package preparation pages
  - Modern, polished design with summary cards, filter tabs, and clean layouts
  - Easy to use and user-friendly across all features
  - Consistent navigation patterns throughout the application

## Recent Updates (November 21, 2025)
- **Operations Dashboard for Executives**: Created new executive-level Operations Dashboard (`/executive/operations`) with read-only KPIs and Chart.js visualizations for system-wide donations, relief requests, and fulfillment metrics. Accessible only to ODPEM_DG, ODPEM_DDG, and ODPEM_DIR_PEOD roles.
- **Executive Dashboard Routing**: Updated main dashboard routing to send executive roles (DG, Deputy DG, Director PEOD) to Operations Dashboard by default. Director Dashboard (eligibility workflow) remains accessible via navigation menu at `/director/dashboard`.
- **Relief Request Tab Counters**: All tab counters now show exact counts matching the number of requests in each tab's list using identical filtering logic. Added "All Requests" tab showing total count. Reorganized tabs: All Requests, Pending Review, Approved, Drafts, Completed.
- **Relief Request Sorting**: All relief request lists now sort by newest first (`.order_by(request_date.desc())` or `.order_by(create_dtime.desc())`), including main lists, workflow tabs, and eligibility queue.
- **Dynamic Status Dropdown**: Fixed batch allocation drawer to properly update status dropdowns by calling main page's `updateAllocation()` function.

## System Architecture
The application employs a modular blueprint architecture with a database-first approach, built upon a pre-existing ODPEM `aidmgmt-3.sql` schema.

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11, Flask 3.0.3
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0.32 with Flask-SQLAlchemy
- **Authentication**: Flask-Login 0.6.3 with Werkzeug
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendering with Jinja2, Bootstrap 5.3.3, Bootstrap Icons
- **Data Processing**: Pandas 2.2.2

### System Design
- **UI/UX Design**: Emphasizes a consistent modern UI, comprehensive design system, shared Jinja2 components, GOJ branding, accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA), and standardized workflow patterns. Features role-specific dashboards and complete management modules for various entities with CRUD operations, validation, and optimistic locking.
- **Notification System**: Includes real-time in-app notifications with badge counters, offcanvas panels, deep-linking, read/unread tracking, and bulk operations.
- **Donation Processing**: Manages the full workflow for donations, including intake, verification, batch-level tracking, expiry date management, and integration with warehouse inventory.
- **Database Architecture**: Based on a 40-table ODPEM schema, ensuring data consistency, auditability, precision, and optimistic locking. Features an enhanced `public.user` table, a new `itembatch` table for batch-level inventory (FEFO/FIFO), and a composite primary key for the `inventory` table.
- **Data Flow Patterns**: Supports an end-to-end AIDMGMT Relief Workflow, role-based dashboards, two-tier inventory management, eligibility approval, and package fulfillment with batch-level editing capabilities.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implemented through a centralized feature registry, dynamic navigation, security decorators, smart routing based on primary roles, and a defined role hierarchy. Features secure user management with role assignment restrictions to prevent privilege escalation; includes both client-side role filtering and server-side validation to prevent bypass attacks.
- **Timezone Standardization**: All datetime operations, database timestamps, audit trails, and user-facing displays use Jamaica Standard Time (UTC-05:00) consistently.
